### About

Just your average Joe with a 9-5 job and a passion for learning about Bitcoin. As my knowledge increases I try to give back through education. I am not a programmer or developer, nor do I have any prior technical experience. I have been fortunate enough to speak regularly with some smart and generous people who help me understand these complex topics, which I then try to present in an approachable way for others to learn.

This page is a single collection of my contributions that I can point people towards when starting out. If you find it valuable, please share it with your peers.
